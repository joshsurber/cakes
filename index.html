            You only get so many weddings in your life, and a big part of them
            is the cake. Make your next wedding more special than the last with
            a beautiful, custom design.

          <h2>Birthdays</h2>

          <p>
            Birthdays are important. Whether you are celebrating your partner's
            birthday, your child's, your dog's, or you are just a very sad
            person ordering a cake for your own birthday, I can make a special
            cake for the special day. From small cupcakes to a cake big enough
            to hold all of <strong>my</strong> candles, it'll be the highlight
            of any celebration.

            Graduation? Office party? Sportsball win? A six-foot-long penis cake
            for a bachelorette party? I can do that.

          <p>
            Chocolate covered strawberries. Giant cookies. Muffins. Pizza. Well,
            maybe not pizza, but I can decorate a giant cookie to look like a
            pizza, if that's your thing.

        <!-- Hi there! My name is Tina Orosco. I live in San Antonio Tx, I’m an associate Pastor’s wife, mother of 5 and 4 bonus children, grandma to 7 beautiful grandchildren and one on the way. I have had a passion for baking as far as I can remember. Baking sparked this joy inside of me that I couldn't get enough of. It's hard to explain, but I think anyone out there who loves baking knows what I mean. Back in the early 90’s I got my first job in a bakery at Safeway and that’s when my passion grew not only for baking but for cake decorating. I would watch the cake decorators decorate cakes and was amazed at how beautiful the cakes looked. That’s when I started teaching myself I learned really quickly and before I knew it I was working as head cake decorator not only for Safeway but for several different bakeries. When I was not working as a decorator I still made cakes on the side for family and friends birthdays, weddings and other special occasions. I have been decorating and baking for more than 31 years and still enjoy learning, there are so many new cakes I would love to make. Decorating to me is a work of art and very fulfilling. I’m thankful that God has given me this passion and talent to spread joy with my cakes. -->
