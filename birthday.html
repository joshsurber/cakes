  Hi there! My name is Tina Orosco. I live in San Antonio Tx, I’m an associate
  Pastor’s wife, mother of 5 and 4 bonus children, grandma to 7 beautiful
  grandchildren and one on the way. I have had a passion for baking as far as I
  can remember. Baking sparked this joy inside of me that I couldn't get enough
  of. It's hard to explain, but I think anyone out there who loves baking knows
  what I mean. Back in the early 90’s I got my first job in a bakery at Safeway
  and that’s when my passion grew not only for baking but for cake decorating. I
  would watch the cake decorators decorate cakes and was amazed at how beautiful
  the cakes looked. That’s when I started teaching myself I learned really
  quickly and before I knew it I was working as head cake decorator not only for
  Safeway but for several different bakeries. When I was not working as a
  decorator I still made cakes on the side for family and friends birthdays,
  weddings and other special occasions. I have been decorating and baking for
  more than 31 years and still enjoy learning, there are so many new cakes I
  would love to make. Decorating to me is a work of art and very fulfilling. I’m
  thankful that God has given me this passion and talent to spread joy with my
  cakes.
