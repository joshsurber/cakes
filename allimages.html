        Hi there! My name is Tina Orosco. I live in San Antonio Tx, I’m an
        associate Pastor’s wife, mother of 5 and 4 bonus children, grandma to 7
        beautiful grandchildren and one on the way. I have had a passion for
        baking as far as I can remember. Baking sparked this joy inside of me
        that I couldn't get enough of. It's hard to explain, but I think anyone
        out there who loves baking knows what I mean. Back in the early 90’s I
        got my first job in a bakery at Safeway and that’s when my passion grew
        not only for baking but for cake decorating. I would watch the cake
        decorators decorate cakes and was amazed at how beautiful the cakes
        looked. That’s when I started teaching myself I learned really quickly
        and before I knew it I was working as head cake decorator not only for
        Safeway but for several different bakeries. When I was not working as a
        decorator I still made cakes on the side for family and friends
        birthdays, weddings and other special occasions. I have been decorating
        and baking for more than 31 years and still enjoy learning, there are so
        many new cakes I would love to make. Decorating to me is a work of art
        and very fulfilling. I’m thankful that God has given me this passion and
        talent to spread joy with my cakes.
