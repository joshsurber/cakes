quote: "I contacted Mrs. Tina to see if she could do a gluten free cake for a Baby shower and sent her a picture of what I was looking for. She did an awesome job; the cake tasted great! You would have never know that it was gluten free. The design was perfect and fit right into the theme of the baby shower. Thank you! I would recommend her work."
