Hello! My name is Tina Orosco! Welcome to my site! Here is a little bit about
me...

I live in San Antonio, in the Great State of Texas. My husband Tony is an
associate pastor at [Texas Baptist Church](http://tbcsanantonio.com), God has
blessed us through the church with a [homeless
ministry](https://www.tbcsanantonio.com/the-homless-ministry) where we have
seen thousands come to Christ. I help to teach junior church and also help feed
the homeless. We will be celebrating our ten year anniversary in November of 2022. We have nine children between us and eight beautiful grandchildren. God
has been so good to us and has blessed our lives abundantly.

My favorite place in my home is my kitchen, cooking. Baking has always been my
way of unwinding. I have always had a passion for baking as far back as I can
remember. It sparked a joy inside of me that I could not get enough of. Anyone
who loves baking knows what I mean. The aroma of freshly baked bread, pies or
cookies is just so satisfying. There is something therapeutic about
kneading dough and icing a tray of cupcakes. Baking has always been known to be
good for the soul, even more so than cooking. It is done in peace and quiet and
with no rush. I began baking for family and friends for Thanksgiving and
Christmas. My homemade pecan and pumpkin pies, and pineapple upside down cake
were everyone's favorite.

Back in the early 90's I got my first job in the bakery at Safeway, and that's
where my love for cake decorating began. I watched the cake decorators and was
amazed how they created a work of art with a cake and icing, and I wanted to so
the same I watched and learned, and taught myself. Before I knew it, I was
decorating professionally. I love it. You are allowed to have fun, experiment,
and let your creative mind go to work. It is a lot of hard work,
but also a rewarding experience. Watching people "ooh" and "ahh"
and enjoy the masterpiece you spent the last three days working on
is incredibly fulfilling, even if it does get destroyed in a matter
of minutes. :-)

Please keep in mind that my cakes are higher in cost than store bought cakes.
All of my cakes are custom made with fresh ingredients. I strive for perfection
so lots of time, care to detail, and a generous helping of love go into every
order. The end results are so delicious!

Thank you for taking the time to read, and visiting my site. I hope you share
my link with friends and family, and consider me for all your special occasion
baked good needs!
