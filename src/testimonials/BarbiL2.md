quote: "I have ordered cakes from Tina on two occasions. One for a Baby Shower and one for my daughter's graduation. Tina also made cupcakes for the graduation party. In both instances the cakes/cupcakes looked and tasted phenomenal! They were made exactly to our specifications and were carefully and beautifully decorated. Tina obviously takes great pride in meeting the expectations of her customers. On a side note, she made me a birthday cake. It was obvious she took her time to think and plan the execution out to the smallest of details. I highly recommend Tina for your upcoming celebration."
