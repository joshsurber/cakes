quote: "Tina did an AMAZING job with my wedding cake!! It was absolutely delicious, beautiful and she gave me exactly what I asked for! She even went out of her way to add the flowers! Other then my dress, it was the talk of the night!! Everyone LOVED it. By the end of the night it was absolutely GONE! That tells you all you need to know! I’m so thankful my mother in law cut and saved us a piece to freeze or else we wouldn’t of had it! You won’t regret having Tina do your cake, she is so good at what she does, and professional!"
